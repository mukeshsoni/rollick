- css reset
  - Why it's important
- css flexbox
  - what is it and why it's awesome
- iframe
  - when to use it (scoping of styles for tools which render code from outside it's domain)
  - gotchas
  - how to use it with react
    - react-frame-component is awesome
- serializing javascript functions
  - JSON doesn't support javascript functions
  - i serialized functions as strings. That meant deserializing became a 2 step process. First do JSON.parse(serializedString), and then run another pass on each of the parsed entities to get the functions out specifically
- Write your own utility library for each of your side projects. Don't just import lodash or ramda. Writing the utility functions again and again is good javascript practice ;)
- react-docgen is awesome. It reads files which describe react components and creates meta data about that component
- react-fake-props is an idea in the right direction. Read the meta data created by react docgen and then try creating fake data reading the types of the props
- ASTs are awesome. probably. If one wants to do any fancy stuff with editors, knowing about ASTs is a must. Not yet directly using ASTs but through other tools like prettier/sass-compiler etc. But planning to use AST for multiple things
  - AST to determine the component in which the cursor is placed in the jsx editor. And accordingly show a attribute pane where users can visually change prop values
  - AST to show better auto completions for custom react components
